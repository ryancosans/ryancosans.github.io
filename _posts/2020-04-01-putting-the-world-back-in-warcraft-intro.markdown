If you want to skip the intro and go straight the posts the links are right here:

- [Dungeons]({% post_url 2020-04-01-putting-the-world-back-in-warcraft-dungeons %})
- [Raids]({% post_url 2020-04-06-putting-the-world-back-in-warcraft-raids %})

This is my take on the current state of World of Warcraft and what classic has taught me about retail World of Warcraft and what I hope it has taught the developers at Blizzard.

When writing this I decided to make a conscious effort to not only point out what I dislike but also mention what I do like and make suggestions to perhaps improve what is currently there if I do dislike it.

I will also be comparing the current game "retail" to World of Warcraft: Classic "classic" a lot throughout this.

Because this is a game I truly love and because I genuinely want it to be better I will try and avoid simply complaining and try to offer solutions. This will also likely have to be many separate posts. I will add links to all of the posts below as I finish them.
