This is my first post so here it goes.

My name is Ryan Cosans and I'm a full stack dev from Essex currently working for TransferWise in London.

I will be using this to blog share my ideas mostly regarding tech and programming but also about films, video games and maybe some other stuff. Especially if I think it's either really cool or really annoying.

I'm very poorly educated to if misspeled words anoy you ðŸ‘‹by.

A little more about me. I'm a massive rugby fan and love the occasional game. Swing low ðŸŒ¹

I'm into basketball and play pickup games mostly in the summer. ðŸŸ£ðŸŸ¡

I snowboard and skateboard in the appropriate seasons.

If you want the occasional post bitching about stuff that annoys me day to day, twitter etc below.
